  <h2><strong>OK. LET'S START COOKING.</strong></h2>
<p>
  <ol type="a">

    <li>Blanch the Pork Belly, then rinse it in cold water to remove residual grime. Cut the Pork Belly into pieces of 8 cm wide and 1.5 cm thick.</li>
    <li>Generously marinade the sliced Pork Belly in the Thick Dark Soya Sauce and leave it standing at room temperature for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Fry the spices till fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the marinated Pork Belly and give the Pork Belly some browning.</li>
    <li>Add Brown Sugar and simmer the Pork Belly enough water to over them. You would want to make sure that you have sufficent gravy to serve with the meat after cooking. You can add in more Thick Dark Soya Sauce if you think the dish looks too pale..</li>
    <li>When the meat is almost tender to your liking, add Light Soya Sauce and more Brown Sugar to taste. Continue cooking to the doneness you prefer.</li>
    <li>When the meat is cooked, put aside the meat from the sauce. Strain the sauce to remove the spices. This will make it easier to enjoy the dish without having to bite into something awlful.</li>
    <li>Put back the meat into the sauce and heat up the dish again. You can now add in the Chinese Rice Wine and thicken the sauce with Corn Starch.</li>
    <li>You can then serve the dish with the pao for Kong Bak Pao or with rice or with lettuce - the way the Koreans enjoy their meat. I like to garnish them with coriander and with loads of sliced chilli padi.</li>
