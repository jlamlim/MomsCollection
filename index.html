    <h1><strong>Mom's Collection</h1></strong>

    <p>A collection of Agak Agak Recipes shared by family and friends, garnished with old wives' tales and some unashamedly adapted from publications.</p>
    <p>I am grateful to all!</p>
    <p>Most of the recipes do not include measurements and if they do, the measurements are not pointedly exact. We usually like to tamper the measurements to suit our personal tastes and we forgot to count the measurements as we continue cooking. What this means is that you should have had successfully cooked something edible in your lifetime and be able to also "Agak-Agak" (estimate / gauge) the measurements.
    <p>I'm also kind of interested in the science of cooking. I am going to do a little reading on this. I hope I can share some insights once I've started to gather them. I will build them in <a href="our chemistry.html">Our Chemistry</a>.</p>
    <p>I would also like to share with you <a href="something borrowed.html">Something Borrowed</a>, some YouTube cooking videos that I like.</p>
    <p><em>(P.S. This is my first attempt at website development, learning is in progress @ <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?referralCode=F2958B9D9447BDFC8244">Angela Yu @ Udemy</a> ). I've barely touched the surface of this course thus pardon if this website project is not that palatable).</em></p>
