    <ol type="a">
      <li>Preheat oven to 180°C and grease your cake tin (estimate size 25x10 cm or its equivalent).</li>
      <br>
      <li>Cream the butter with the sugar and the orange zest. Cream till light and fluffy.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Add in two eggs at a time (1 whole egg + 1 egg yolk) and mix them well before continuing with the remaining eggs. Mix in the orange juice as you go along. The yolks allow the small amount of watery egg white and juice to blend with the butter mix. </li>
      <br>
      <li>Sift in the flour (second sifting) and fold them well into the batter.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Pour batter in the cake tin and bake for approximately 40 minutes. Test the cake with a skewer to ensure that cake is properly baked - skewer must come up dry.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Cool cake completely before serving.</li>
