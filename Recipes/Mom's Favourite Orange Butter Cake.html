    <tr>
      <td>3 large eggs whole eggs + 3 egg yolks</td>
      <td>Eggs kept at room temperature. Need not be laid by kampong chickens. Egg yolks are supposed to provide the moisture whilst the whites are drying agents. Egg yolks are emulsifier, allowing water and fat to blend together</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
  <td>100 gram caster sugar</td>
  <td>I've reduced the amount of sugar by 1/3 from most standard cake recipes - got to watch my sugar intake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>160 gram cake flour</td>
  <td>Sift the flour. Read that cake flour preferred for light cakes vs good old all purpose plain flour. Need all the help I can for a novice "baker" like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1 teaspoon baking powder</td>
  <td>Sift together with the cake flour. Baking powder is supposed to increase the volume and lighten the texture of the cake. It realises carbon dioxide gas in the batter. I use the double action type, just in case my cake refuse to rise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>150 gram salted butter</td>
  <td>Thawed but not melted.Cut into small pieces for easier creaming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1 large orange</td>
  <td>Zest and juice the orange</td>
</tr>

  <h2><strong>NOW LET'S GET BUSY</strong></h2>

<ol type="a">
  <li>Preheat oven to 180¬∞C and grease your cake tin (estimate size 25x10 cm or its equivalent).</li>
  <li>Cream the butter with the sugar and the orange zest. Cream till light and fluffy.</li>
  <li>Add eggs two by two (1 whole egg + 1 yolk together) and mix them well. Slowing add in the orange juice as you go along. The yolks allow the small amount of watery egg white and juice to blend with the butter mix. </li>
  <li>Sift in the flour (second sifting) and fold them well into the batter.</li>
  <li>Pour batter in the cake tin and bake for approximately 40 minutes. Test the cake with a skewer to ensure that cake is properly baked - skewer must come up dry.</li>
  <li>Cool cake completely before serving.</li>
